<!--RULES FOR TEXT:
	1) Scale 
		- Emphasising size of specific words; select words from each line = larger than rest
		- All text = same, large size; fills entire screen, squashed 
		- Copy and paste text multiple times, small font.  
	2) Font/ structure
		- Times
		- Futura
		- Mixing Times w Futura to emphasise certain words
	3) Rotation 
		- All text = rotated in same direction
		- Each line = rotated in different direction; random
		- Text = rotated to form a spiral that grows inward.
	4) Opacity
		- Same opacity (~30%); text overlaps completely. Almost illegible
		- Certain words = fully opaque, some words = almost transparent 
		- Same opacity (~30%), but certain words = diff colour for emphasis; text legibility. See if meaning of overall text can change. 
	5) Form 
		- All caps
		- All lowercase
		- Mix the two (capitalise words for emphasis)
	(if any of these don't work out) 6) Weight / 7) Spacing

	* TREAT TEXT AS IMAGE
	* Mainly use Futura

See these eyes so red<br>
Red like jungle burning bright<br>
Those who feel me near<br>
Pull the blinds and change their minds<br>
It's been so long<br>
Still this pulsing night<br>
A plague I call a heartbeat<br>
Just be still with me<br>
You wouldn't believe what I've been through<br>
You've been so long<br>
Well it's been so long<br>


QUESTIONS:
- How do you centre text within a div? 
- Whats the scope for animation within the class (i.e. just motion graphics/ simple animations)?
- How do I change text size while still keeping all the words in the same line?
